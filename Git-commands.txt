Git Basic commands and setup
============================
* Install git/git-bash

* Create project directory - We can create files directly inside the repository if we want.
Eg: touch index.html, touch app.js, touch .gitignore, touch README.md

* The files or directories added in the .gitignore file will not get tracked

** git init
(This will add a hidden .git folder inside directory) 

** configuration
- git config --global user.name 'Sudhil'
- git config --global user.email 'email@gamil.com'

** git status
(Run anytime if we want to know the status of the git tree)

** git add .
(Add all the modified files)

- git add index.html
(This will only the index.html file)

** git rm --cache index.html
(Untrack the tracked file)

** git commit -m 'commit message'
(Commit the staged changes after adding files with a message)

** git log
(To view all the previous commits)

** git branch branch-name
(Create a new branch with branch-name)

** git checkout branch-name
(To switch between branches)

** git checkout -b branch-name
(This will create a new branch switch to it together)

** git merge branch-name
(This will merge the changes made in one branch to another. For eg. if we are in master branch and run the above command, the branch-name will gets merged to master branch)


Remote Repo - Adding/ Pushing the existing local repository to a new remote repository
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Create a repo in GitHub
(Add name and description)

** git remote add origin repo-url (will get 'repo-url' from GitHub)
(This will help us to link our local repository to a remote repository in GitHub)
(Make sure the root branch name is same in both local and remote (Eg:master or main) Otherwise rename it)

** git push -u origin master
(This will push the master branch from local repository to remote repository in GitHub)

* Add a README.md file (We can add directly from GitHub or we can add in local and then push)


** git pull origin master
(Pull/Retrieve the latest changes added in the remote repository to local repository(Eg: To get changes from an other developer))

** git pull origin master --rebase
(This is same as pulling but merge our local master along with the remote master while pulling)


Clone an existing remote repo
------------------------------
** git clone repo-url


*** Once you are familiar with all these basic commands, you can use GUI or the awesome extensions in the IDE (Eg: Extensions like Git History, Git Blame, Git Lens, etc in VS code)
